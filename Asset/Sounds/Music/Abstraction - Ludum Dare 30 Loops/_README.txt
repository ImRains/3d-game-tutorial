Abstraction - Music Loop Bundle
===============================

This ZIP package is the full album download from Itch.io. It contains seamless audio loops ideal for video games and other media.

==== PLEASE NOTE ====
MP3 files will often NOT loop seamlessly. You will notice a very short gap when the song loops. This is due to the nature of the MP3 file format and is often difficult to overcome. I highly suggest using these songs as WAV files or converting to OGG if file size is an issue.
=====================

If you paid to download this album from Itch.io: Thank you very much! I'm extremely happy that this music moved you in some way. There is so much music out there competing for people's attention it is an honor that you decided this is worthwhile enough to pay for. Financial support is an incredible motivator to continue writing music and releasing more music in the future. I wish you the best of luck using these songs inside your games and other media! <3

If you somehow got this album outside of Itch.io: Hi! My name is Ben and I write music. If you like what you hear here, I have more music which can be found through the links below. If you dig what I create, I'd love it if you took a minute and let your friends know over Facebook and Twitter. Not many things are more motivating than a solid recommendation from a friend.
